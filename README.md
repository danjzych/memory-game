# THE MEMORY GAME

The Memory Game is an online game that challenges the user's ability to remember colored cards as they appear before them. The Memory Game was built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.


## Features

The Memory Game has several features:

#### Difficulty Settings
Users can choose between three difficulties - Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each difficulty changes the degree of variance between colors. In easy mode, colors are randomly generated by creating three random numbers and constructing an RGB value from them. Medium constrains the random numbers to two, and Hard to just one number.

#### Best Score Tracking
At the start of the game, users can input their name for the leader board. As users play their total number of guesses is tracked. At the end of the game, if they have set a new recore, the leaderboard is updated with their name and score. Best score is tracked for each difficulty setting, and kept as an object in local storage so that the leaderboard persists across sessions.
